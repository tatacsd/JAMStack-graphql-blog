## Description
This project is to apply the knowledge of Next.js [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and graphcms [graphcms](https://graphcms.com/) to build a JAMStack application. More specifically, this project is to build a blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The blog posts are stored in graphcms and the blog application is built with Next.js. We make use of codegen [codegen](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) to generate typescript types for the api calls to graphcms. We also use tailwindcss [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the blog application. 
For deployment, we use vercel [vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy the blog application.
